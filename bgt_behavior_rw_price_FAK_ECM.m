% Prices are drawn from a uniform distribution centered about the variable
% 'last_order_price' over integers in the closed interval
% [(last_order_price-price_flex),(last_order_price+price_flex)]

% (The distribution at from which prices are drawn gets truncated at
% min_price and max_price, when applicable. Model parameters can be chosen
% so that these boundary conditions are never binding.)
%
% buy/sell direction is symmetric and i.i.d.

% Quantity is drawn from a uniform distribution over integers in the closed
% interval [1,max_quantity]
